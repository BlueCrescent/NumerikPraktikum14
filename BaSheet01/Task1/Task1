1) What does it do?
it prints two not sufficiently seeded "random" variables.
2) The difference between the methods is that rand() returns a random number 
and the other method  
 - rand() returns a random integer between 0 and RANDMAX
 - gsl_rng_mt19937 is a generator that generates random numbers. 
 In the code the generator is passed to a (Distribution)function that uses this generator 
 to evaluate a random number depending on the Distribution specified in the function.
 3) What happens if you remove the expression (double)
 The division operation (rand()/RANDMAX) does (int small / int big) and
 should result in a double, but with no cast it will be floored to 0. 
 4) double gsl_ran_gaussian_pdf(const gsl_rng * r, double sigma)
