\begin{itemize}
	\item What does it do? \\
it prints two not sufficiently seeded "random" variables
	\item The difference between the methods is that rand() returns a random number 
and the other method
  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item rand() returns a random integer between 0 and RANDMAX
		\item gsl\_rng\_mt19937 is a generator that generates random numbers
	\end{itemize}
 In the code the generator is passed to a (Distribution)function that uses this generator 
 to evaluate a random number depending on the Distribution specified in the function.
	\item What happens if you remove the expression (double)?\\
 The division operation $\frac{rand()}{RANDMAX}$ does $\frac{int Small}{int Big}$ and
 should result in a double, but with no cast it will be floored to 0. 
	\item Is there a direct function to generate normally distributed random variables?\\
	double gsl\_ran\_gaussian\_pdf(const gsl\_rng * r, double sigma)
 command
\end{itemize}
